# Well hello there. I am Brunixx.
Outta jokes and all, I just want a nice and decent README.md file, so let's get started with a lot of information about myself and what do I do right now or my later projects that will help me on my way.

## How about you? - Who you are?
Glad you asked, my name here is Brunixx.
- 15 Years old, yeah. I hate those who think just because you are a developer it means you have a mature age and a totally not wicked personality 😎
- I will soon develop HTML5 websites, I'm going to practice about it first by making Wireframes and then possibly with some rad CSS transitions n' stuff. I'll be honest with you guys, it will probably be hard for sure 🐱‍👓
- I like touching grass. Nah just kidding but I usually like playing videogames like ROBLOX or Minecraft. A fan of block games I'd say 📦

## So what are your plans?
That's a good question actually, mainly I'll try to make a blog about myself, maybe telling my daily life stories, maybe just life lessons that teach me how to be a better person and commit less mistakes. 🙆‍♂️
- PS. I actually had one made in Spanish called [La Choza de BC](https://lachozadebc.blogspot.com) which was an early concept of my desires of having a block to share my thoughts in daily life. 🤔

I also thought on maybe doing some web applications, maybe a text processor or something. That depends, however, on how much I learn about programming on HTML5 and my current motivations (Which are low rn) 🤷‍♂️

## So what will you work on?
A website, the one I mentioned upside actually. It MIGHT come as a github repository where I will also explain how did I made all that stuff but it's just a maybe. And I could maybe host it online but that is just a MAYBE for now.

Other than that, I will work on a few scripts written in other languages, some however will be uploaded to my [main account](https://github.com/minecon099) instead since it fits better than my school account (And were actually learnt somewhere else which is NOT school lol)
