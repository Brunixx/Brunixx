### Well hello there. I am Brunixx.
Outta jokes and all, I just want a nice and decent README.md file, so let's get started with a lot of information about myself and what do I do right now or my later projects that will help me on my way.

## How about you? - Who you are?
Glad you asked, my name here is Brunixx.
- 15 Years old, yeah. I hate those who think just because you are a developer it means you have a mature age and a totally not wicked personality 😎
- I will soon develop HTML5 websites, I'm going to practice about it first by making Wireframes and then possibly with some rad CSS transitions n' stuff. I'll be honest with you guys, it will probably be hard for sure 🐱‍👓
- I like touching grass. Nah just kidding but I usually like playing videogames like ROBLOX or Minecraft. A fan of block games I'd say 📦

## To be continued...
